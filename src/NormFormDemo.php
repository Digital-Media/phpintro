/**
 * Example implementation of the norm form class that validates a simple form
 * with two required and one optional parameter.
 *
 * This is an implementation of the @AbstractNormForm class.
 * It defines a concrete example how to validate a form with three
 * input fields where two are required (and therefore checked for emptiness).
 * It also defines a very simple business logic
 * where the resulting contents of the superglobal $_POST are first stored in an variable,
 * then passed on the the view where they are displayed as a table.
